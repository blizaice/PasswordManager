#### What's This?
A simple local "hosted" alternative to Google Password Manager & Authenticator, without autocomplete or passkeys

#### Why would i want to use this?
Any service (including Google) can ban your account, sometimes out of no where. It's nice to have all your accounts stored in multiple places, or out of the Cloud :)

### How to use?
Just check the `json` file, you'll figure out! :D<br>
Here's an example of account: <br>
(fake credentials)
```json
{
"Name": "Main Account",
"Website": "cloudflare.com",
"Email": "me@blizaice.net",
"Note": "Backup Email: personal@blizaice.net",
"Secret": "427226BB42IQT5OBW3XYZRHYYNFJEMD4",
"Password": "V(8Vqm_6nG!bUa_Y23VOgcW*g29H4|d:(KvTHH0];hr:Yr1Xs7PSOal;6Rtj1RCe^jd^UCf>5]_Dk[kg3a*TSpF?|WIz>rt]_%9J]%1tRBUo81H8RF.K|M[t(VLIz}ZCztbfZcKXSR^l}++:VXeroV8mLuG@l;_m,sZ.Xl0^3+oRHApM3$3[6I96p%[p,CY2KdFB*NS>"
}
```

> ãƒ»Images (Logos) are loaded from `/Images` using the `Website` value + `.png`: `google.com.png`. If no image is found, it will try fetching it's `favicon.ico`, in the end displaying `/Images/Default.png` (Placeholder)
